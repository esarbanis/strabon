			Strabon
		      -----------

Introduction
============
Strabon is a fully implemented semantic geospatial database system that can be
used to store linked geospatial data expressed in RDF and query them using an
extension of SPARQL. Strabon supports spatial selections, spatial joins, a rich
set of spatial functions similar to those offered by geospatial relational
database systems, support for multiple Coordinate Reference Systems and widely
used serializations for geometric objects such as WKT and GML. Strabon is built
on top of the well-known RDF store Sesame and extends Sesame’s components to be
able to manage thematic and spatial data that are stored in PostGIS.

The development of Strabon started in the context of European FP7 project
SemsorGrid4Env (Semantic Sensor Grids for Rapid Application Development for 
Environmental Management) [http://www.semsorgrid4env.eu/]. Starting September
2011, Strabon is being utilized and extended with new functionalities in the
FP7 project TELEIOS (Virtual Observatory Infrastructure for Earth Observation
Data) [http://www.earthobservatory.eu/] which our group leads.

The query language of Strabon is called stSPARQL. stSPARQL can be used to query
data represented in an extension of RDF called stRDF. stRDF and stSPARQL have
been designed for representing and querying geospatial data that changes over
time (e.g., the growth of a city over the years due to new developments). 

Currently, only the geospatial features of stSPARQL have been implemented fully.
The temporal features are the subject of current work.

You can find a demo of the system Strabon at http://test.strabon.di.uoa.gr/NOA/.


Getting Started
===============
To get started  with Strabon please have a look at the tutorial for the stRDF
data model and stSPARQL query language, the User Guide, and the Developer Guide.

User Guide
~~~~~~~~~~
Assuming that you are familiar with Maven, the following steps need to be
followed in order to use Strabon using Eclipse:

1. Install PostgreSQL from http://www.postgresql.org/download/. At the time of
   this writing the latest PostgreSQL version is 9.1.
2. Install PostGIS from http://postgis.refractions.net/download/. At the time of
   this writing we have tested Strabon with PostGIS 1.5.3.
3. Install Maven from http://maven.apache.org/download.html. At the time of this
   writing the latest Maven version is 3.0.4. 
4. Install Eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/. At the time of this
   writing the latest Eclipse version is 3.7.2.
5. Install the m2e plugin for Eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/.
6. Install the MercurialEclipse plugin for Eclipse from
   http://javaforge.com/project/HGE .
7. From Eclipse, go to File --> Import --> Mercurial --> Clone Existing
   Mercurial Repository --> Next. In the URL textarea paste the following
   URL: http://hg.strabon.di.uoa.gr/StrabonUser and then press Next --> Next -->
   Finish. If you used the default settings, you should have a new project named
   StrabonMain. Right click on the project and select Configure --> Convert to
   Maven project. Eclipse will enable Maven dependency management for the
   project, download any dependencies and build the project.

Download
========
You can download the source code of the latest version of Strabon by accessing
our public mercurial repository located at http://hg.strabon.di.uoa.gr/Strabon.
You can find more information on how to use and extend Strabon at the Getting
Started section.


Publications
============
You can learn about stRDF data model and stSPARQL query language employed in
Strabon by reading our tutorial under the Getting Started section and/or the
publications given on this page. 

The current versions of stRDF and stSPARQL which are based on OGC standards are
presented in the following document:
