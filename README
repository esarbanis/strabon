			Strabon
		      -----------

Introduction
============
Strabon is a fully implemented semantic geospatial database system that can be
used to store linked geospatial data expressed in RDF and query them using an
extension of SPARQL. Strabon supports spatial selections, spatial joins, a rich
set of spatial functions similar to those offered by geospatial relational
database systems, support for multiple Coordinate Reference Systems and widely
used serializations for geometric objects such as WKT and GML. Strabon is built
on top of the well-known RDF store Sesame and extends Sesame’s components to be
able to manage thematic and spatial data that are stored in PostGIS.

The development of Strabon started in the context of European FP7 project
SemsorGrid4Env (Semantic Sensor Grids for Rapid Application Development for 
Environmental Management) [http://www.semsorgrid4env.eu/]. Starting September
2011, Strabon is being utilized and extended with new functionalities in the
FP7 project TELEIOS (Virtual Observatory Infrastructure for Earth Observation
Data) [http://www.earthobservatory.eu/] which our group leads.

The query language of Strabon is called stSPARQL. stSPARQL can be used to query
data represented in an extension of RDF called stRDF. stRDF and stSPARQL have
been designed for representing and querying geospatial data that changes over
time (e.g., the growth of a city over the years due to new developments). 

Currently, only the geospatial features of stSPARQL have been implemented fully.
The temporal features are the subject of current work.

Given the very close relationship between stSPARQL and GeoSPARQL which is a 
recent OGC standard for an extension of SPARQL for querying geospatial metadata,
we recently provided support for the Core, Geometry and Geometry Topology 
extension of GeoSPARQL. 


Strabon Homepage
================
The homepage of Strabon is at http://www.strabon.di.uoa.gr/.


Demo
====
You can find a demo of the system Strabon at http://test.strabon.di.uoa.gr/NOA/.


Getting Started
===============
To get started  with Strabon please have a look at the tutorial for the stRDF
data model and stSPARQL query language, the User Guide, and the Developer Guide.

stRDF and stSPARQL tutorial
	http://www.strabon.di.uoa.gr/files/stSPARQL_tutorial.pdf


stSPARQL Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The reference for the spatial and temporal extension functions defined in 
stSPARQL can be found at http://www.strabon.di.uoa.gr/stSPARQL#spatial and
http://www.strabon.di.uoa.gr/stSPARQL#temporals respectively.


User Guide
~~~~~~~~~~
Assuming that you are familiar with Maven, the following steps need to be
followed in order to use Strabon using Eclipse:

1. Install PostgreSQL from http://www.postgresql.org/download/. At the time of
   this writing the latest PostgreSQL version is 9.1.
2. Install PostGIS from http://postgis.refractions.net/download/. At the time of
   this writing we have tested Strabon with PostGIS 1.5.3.
3. Install Maven from http://maven.apache.org/download.html. At the time of this
   writing the latest Maven version is 3.0.4. 
4. Install Eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/. At the time of this
   writing the latest Eclipse version is 3.7.2.
5. Install the m2e plugin for Eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/.
6. Install the MercurialEclipse plugin for Eclipse from
   http://javaforge.com/project/HGE .
7. From Eclipse, go to File --> Import --> Mercurial --> Clone Existing
   Mercurial Repository --> Next. In the URL textarea paste the following
   URL: http://hg.strabon.di.uoa.gr/StrabonUser and then press Next --> Next -->
   Finish. If you used the default settings, you should have a new project named
   StrabonMain. Right click on the project and select Configure --> Convert to
   Maven project. Eclipse will enable Maven dependency management for the
   project, download any dependencies and build the project. 


	Storing stRDF graphs and evaluating stSPARQL queries
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can see some examples in the classes gr.uoa.di.strabon.example.PostgisExample
and gr.uoa.di.strabon.example.PostgisExample2.

	Tuning PostgreSQL
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The default settings of Postgres are rather conservative. As a result, parameter 
tuning is neccessary for speeding up Postgres, therefore Strabon. If you are 
using Strabon to compare its performance against your implementation of 
stSPARQL/GeoSPARQL, you are *strongly* encouraged to contact us using the Strabon
Users mailing list for assistance on tuning Postgres.

You can follow the instructions below for tuning a Postgres server running on an 
Ubuntu machine that is dedicated to PostgreSQL and Strabon.

1. Append the following text at the end of postgresql.conf. 
*Uncomment* the appropriate lines.

Bugs
====
Please report bugs to http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/report or
the Strabon-devel mailing-list Strabon-devel@di.uoa.gr.


Known Issues
============
 * By default, Tomcat uses ISO-8859-1 character encoding when decoding URLs received 
   from a browser. This can cause problems when encoding is UTF-8, and you are using 
   international characters. In order to fix this, edit conf/server.xml and find the 
   line where the Connector is defined. Add the parameter URIEncoding and set it to 
   UTF-8. For example:

   <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" 
                  connectionTimeout="20000" 
                  URIEncoding="UTF-8"
                  redirectPort="8443" />

 * Building and executing any maven goals fails for maven versions <3.0 due to a
   dependency to the `shade' plugin that is available only for maven version 3.0
   (http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/). In such systems, you may
   disable execution of this plugin by setting the environmental variable
   `shade.skip'. For example, to build Strabon using maven version 2.0 you may
   execute the following command:

   	$ mvn clean package -Dshade.skip

 * When using MonetDB as a backend, the following source code of MonetDB must be 
   used:
	https://hg.strabon.di.uoa.gr/MonetDB/
