	* Version 3.2.5 released.

	* Updated KML writer to include the projected variables of an stSPARQL
	query in "ExtendedData" and "Data" tags. This is the proper way to
	do it if we need to convert a KML to a ESRI shapefile and also include
	such information as attributes for a feature. See related pages from
	KML specification:
		<https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#extendeddata>
		<https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/extendeddata>

	* Added user authentication for storing RDF data through Strabon
	Endpoint. Now, 

	* Strabon Endpoints now limits the number of the results to a maximum
	one. The maximum number is specified in the beans.xml file. This
	corresponds to parameter "maxLimit". The endpoint script has also been
	updated correspondingly; the limit can be given using the option "-l".
	One can disable limiting of query results, by setting the "maxLimit"
	parameter to 0. Addresses Bug #6
	(<http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/6>).

	* Added "Known Issues" section to README.

	* Added -m (more memory) and -M (much more memory) options in strabon
	script for out-of-memory exceptions.

	* Fixed Bug #10 (<http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/10>). Now KMLWriter 
	handles more geometric types (other than polygons). See changeset 
	9a3bfee64a39.

	* Menu and navigation in Strabon Endpoint has changed to use jquery.
	The menu is now populated using the queries placed inside the beans.xml.

	* Added BrowseBean and browse.jsp for browsing the RDF data using the
	Strabon Endpoint.
