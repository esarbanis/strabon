	* Completed implementation of the period function, that constructs
	  a period with start and end points the given arguments
	* Fixed a bug that would not return the correct spatial datatype of a
	  projected geometry literal stored in the database.
	  (bug #71: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/71)

	* Now, geometries expressed in CRS84 and a `geo:wktLiteral' datatype
	  are assigned the correct CRS, i.e., EPSG:4326 with a longitude
	  latitude axis order.

	* Now, we report a parse error when a constant geometry given in a
	  SELECT or HAVING clause is not well-formed according to the WKT
	  specification.
	  (bug #69: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/69)

	* Function `geof:convexHull' is now supported in a Having clause.

	* Fixed older implementation of `strdf:distance' that would expect two
	  arguments instead of three when present in a HAVING clause.

	* Fixed a bug that would cause a class cast exception for grounded
	  expressions with function nesting in the SELECT or HAVING clause.

	* Fixed a bug in which `postgis:ST_Centroid' did not work in the SELECT
	  clause with input geometries from the database.

	* Fixed a bug that `geof:getSRID' would return an integer instead of a
	  the URI corrresponding to the CRS that the input geometry was
	  expressed.
	  (bug #32:  http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/32)
	* Fixed a bug that would raise an exception for queries involving two
	  UNION graph patterns and a projection to a predicate or a URI in
	  general.
	  (bug #53: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/53)

Wed Sep 17 20:14:12 2014   Pyravlos Team

	* Version 3.2.10 released.

	* The test suite of Strabon has now reached a mature level. It
	  contains tests for both stSPARQL and GeoSPARQL query languages and
	  most of the compliance tests covered in the specification of
	  GeoSPARQL (well, only those tests for the components that we have
	  chosen to implement). 

	* The endpoint now parses Accept headers with multiple values and uses
	  the first mimetype corresponding to a valid stSPARQLQueryResultFormat.
	  (bug #64: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/64)

	* The endpoint now registers a handler for SIGTERM signals, so that if
	  it is run from the command-line (endpoint-exec), then the closing of
	  the connection will be ultimately called.
	  (bug #40: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/40)

	* Strabon goes debian v1. the endpoint-exec jar is now given in a .deb 
          format. By dpkg-ing it, one can run a stand alone strabon endpoint
          locally.
	  (bug #45 http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/58)

	* Fixed a bug in which Strabon hanged when a unary spatial construct 
	  had a ternary spatial construct as argument. 
	  (bug #45 http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/45)

	* Fixed a bug according to which spatial functions in ORDER BY were not
	  evaluated at all.
	  (bug #62: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/62)

	* Fixed a bug according to which spatial boolean functions appearing
	  in the SELECT clause were raising a NULL pointer exception.
	  (bug #34: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/34)

	* Fixed a bug in queries that contain variables that exist inside 
	  spatial functions in select and do not exist in the where clause 
	  made Strabon throw a NULL pointer exception.
	  (bug #51 https://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/51)

	* Various changes in the interface and behavior of Strabon Endpoint:
	  - Revised the logos and the sample queries.
	  - Results query limit is set to zero (unlimited).
	  - Users can now store RDF data that is present in a file on the
	    client side (the file is uploaded to the server).
	  - Credentials are now required for uploading files or executing
	    UPDATE queries, unless Strabon Endpoint runs locally (localhost).
	  - When viewing the results of queries in HTML, any URI is now an
	    active link to itself. Previously, that URI was being DESCRIBEd
	    and one was being transferred to a page viewing the result of the
	    DESCRIBE query.
	  - The DESCRIBE functionality can now be accessed through the menu bar.
	
	* Fixed a bug where strdf:intersection function did not work as an
	  aggregate when used without 'GROUP BY'.
	  (bug #46 https://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/46)


Sat Oct 19 23:37:23 2013   Pyravlos Team

	* Version 3.2.9 released.

	* Added support for the following google chart types: PieChart, 
	AreaChart and ColumnChart to strabon endpoint. 
	
	* Added Timemap as new results format in Strabon endpoint. This 
	option displays results in a map and a timeline on the same time, 
	using the Timemap js library (http://code.google.com/p/timemap/).
	The KMLWriter has been extended for that purpose, by transforming
	dateTime values that are included in the result set into the respective
	TimeStamp KML primitive (https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/time). 
	In the "temporals" branch, the values of the strdf:period datatype 
	are converted into the respective KML TimeSpan primitive. 
	
	* Added extension function <http://postgis.net/ST_Centroid> which is
	mapped to the ST_Centroid(geometry) extension function of PostGIS.
	See also: <http://postgis.org/docs/ST_Centroid.html>.

	* Added extension function <http://postgis.net/ST_MakeLine> which is
	mapped to the ST_MakeLine(geometry, geometry) extension function of
	PostGIS. See also: <http://postgis.org/docs/ST_MakeLine.html>.

	* Added PostGIS vocabulary class.

	* Added support of all SPARQL result types provided by Sesame (json,
	xml, csv, tsv, binary). To get the respective writer, just prepend the
	string "SPARQL/", e.g., "SPARQL/JSON". This is to ensure that we
	support all SPARQL result formats of the SPARQL Protocol.

	* Fixed a bug where a non-implemented extension function would make
	Strabon throw a NULL pointer exception. Now we get away with it
	through a warning.

	* Strabon endpoint now publishes the URIs of the supported units of
	measure for use in strdf:distance and geof:distance functions of
	stSPARQL and GeoSPARQL, respectively. The URIs are those defined by
	OGC Units of Measure 1.0 specification which may be found at
	http://www.opengis.net/def/uom/OGC/1.0/. Strabon endpoint publishes
	the URIs at http://localhost:8080/endpoint/Capabilities.

	* Created new module with name 'vocab` and artifactId
	'strabon-vocabulary` and moved GeoConstants.java there. Other
	vocabularies have been added as well, such as Simple Features, and
	GeoSPARQL.

	* Strabon endpoint now publishes the URIs of the supported extension
	functions for stSPARQL and GeoSPARQL. One should access them by
	hitting the link http://localhost:8080/endpoint/Capabilities.

	* Support for parsing EPSG URIs in geometry literals with datatype
	geo:wktLiteral.
	(bug #33: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/33)
	
	* Endpoint Client now supports querying of Virtuoso and Parliament endpoints.

	* Endpoint Client now supports store and update operations, but only
	for Strabon Endpoints.

	*Modified the NQUADSTranslator so that the rewritten triples are 
	immediately flushed to the database once they are created. 
	
	*In the N-Quads format, the fourth element is *optional*. Made proper
	modification to the storage manager to coply to the specification 
	described here: http://sw.deri.org/2008/07/n-quads/. Now files in
	NQUADS format can contain quads *or* triples in order to be stored
	successfully in Strabon.
	
	*Fixed bug that occurs when storing periods having "UC" as ending 
	point. 
	
	*Added an initial set of tests on temporal operations in the 
	testsuite module.
	
	*Completed support for temporal updates
	
	*Moved vocabulary related to the temporal features of Strabon to the
	respective "vocabulary" project

	*The evaluation of temporal joins in the database does not produce
	cartesian products in the database

	* GeoSPARQL functions sfCrosses, sfOverlaps, ehOverlaps do not use the 
	ST_Relate PostGIS function (bug #24: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/24)

	* All Simple Features functions of GeoSPARQL do not use the ST_Relate 
	PostGIS function

	* Added diffTime function. This function performs the difference 
	between two literals of xsd:time datatype and returns a literal of
	the xsd:time datatype as well.
	
	* Added a testsuite package in default branch. Full tester guide can be found
	in README. Among other, most of GeoSPARQL compliance tests  
	(https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=47664, pg. 53) have been 
	implemented.

	* Changed the definition and implementation of strdf:distance function, by
	adopting the definition of GeoSPARQL.
	(bug #23: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/23) 

	* Changed the definition and implementation of strdf:buffer function, by
        adopting the definition of GeoSPARQL.
        (bug #35: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/35)

	* Added geof:distance and geof:buffer functions, which have the same definition
	with strdf:distance and strdf:buffer respectively.
	(bug #32: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/32)

	* Added a download button when performing describe and construct queries at the
        endpoint.
        (bug #38: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/38)

	* Fixed a bug, where XMLWriter and TSVWriter did not return geometries with the
	SRID.
	(bug #47: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/47)

	* Fixed a bug where the GeoSPARQL construct functions did not return the datatype 
	geo:wktLiteral datatype but strdf:WKT.

Tue Mar 26 13:28:26 2013   Pyravlos Team

	* Version 3.2.8 released.

	* Added support for handling (storing/querying) GeoSPARQL datatypes.
	(bug #31: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/31)

	* Fixed a bug in StoreOp that wouldn't close the connection, neither
	rollback the transaction upon an exception. This had as a side effect
	the abnormal termination of StoreOp (through for example the use of
	Ctrl-C signal) which was leaving the database locked.

	* Fixed bug where spatial aggregates (e.g., union) didn't work as
	expected when the query didn't contain a `GROUP BY' clause.
	(bug #22: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/22)

	* Updated GeoSPARQL namespaces and fixed function names to comply with
	the GeoSPARQL specification.
	(bug #25: http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/25)
	
	*Added preliminary tests on temporal functions in the respective
	"test" package of the runtime module.
	
	*Added option to strabon and endpoint scripts to support storing
	files in NQUADS format.
	
	*When a large file in NQUADS format is going to be stored, it is 
	partitioned and stored in parts. This happens because the translation
	of quads to triples is a memory intensive job, so, translating and 
	storing the file in batches increases performance.


Wed Jan 09 18:06:41 2013   Pyravlos Team

	* Version 3.2.7 released.

	* Add an extension function 
	<http://strdf.di.uoa.gr/extensions/ontology#diffDateTime> for computing the
	span (in milliseconds) between two timestamps.

	* Added an <endpoint-exec> module. This module builds an executable jar file 
	with an embedded Apache Tomcat 7. To create and run the executable jar just 
	type:
		$ mvn clean package
		$ java -jar endpoint-exec/target/strabon-endpoint-executable-*.jar

	* Modified strabon script and postgis/monetdb.StoreOP class to get an
	option for storing a RDF file in a named graph. Moreover, the RDF
	format of the input RDF file now is given as an option (still, if it
	is missing, it is assumed that the input is in N-TRIPLES format). The
	option for the format is -f and the option for the named graph is -g
	(takes a URI as an argument).

	* Modified the names of the stSPARQL extension functions that
	utilize the minimum bounding boxes of the involved geometries.
	
	*Fixed bug in the evaluation of temporal constructs. 
	
	*Fixed a major bug that occured when a temporal variable that also took part
	in a temporal join was projected.
	
	*Renamed temporal extension functions to comply with the respective
	functions of Allen's temporal relations. 
	
	*Modified the implementation of the temporal relation functions
	"meets", "starts", "finishes", to comply with the semantics of the
	respective functions of Allen. These functions are not supported by
	PostgreSQL Temporal, so, in order to be evaluated in the database 
	level,  we implemented them as PostgreSQL extension functions. 
	ATTENTION: In order to use these functions, the respective sql script
	that includes them should be loaded to the the temporally (and spa-
	tially) enabled database. 
	

Tue Dec 11 19:33:45 2012   Pyravlos Team

	* Version 3.2.6 released.

	* Modified the names of the stSPARQL extension functions to comply  
	with the OGC Simple Features Access standard.

Tue Dec 11 00:11:43 2012   Pyravlos Team

	* Version 3.2.5 released.

	* Added support for storing and querying temporal information. 
	This functionality may be found in the `temporals' branch. 
	
		 *The datatypes <http://strdf.di.uoa.gr/ontology#period> and
		<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime> are used to
		represent periods and instants respectively. 
	
		*The valid time time of triples is represented using quadtruples,
		with the valid time annotation(instant or period) being the
		fourth element of the quad. Into this direction:
			*Strabon has been extended to support the NQUADS format. The
			respective Sesame packages (of version 2.6.9) that support
			this format are used. 
			
			*NQuadTranslator class has been created. This class uses the
			NQUADS parser which is available here: https://github.com/joshsh/sesametools/tree/develop/nquads.
			The initial version of this parser did not include support 
			for literals as the fourth element of the quad. We exteded
			it to support the valid time representations described above.
			
			*The NQUADSTranslator translates quads into triples using the
			named graph approach, similar to the one proposed by Tappolet
			et al. and described in http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1561565. 
			
			*The rdbms level of Strabon has been extended to (i) support
			tha period datatype (ii) store the period values in the table
			period_values(id, period). The period column is of the period
			datatype, offered by the PostgreSQL Temporal extension (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgsql-temporal/). 
			Also, a GiST index is created on this column.
			
			*A rewriting mechanism that converts quad graph patterns into
			 triple partners using the named graphs approach has been
			 implemented as a method of the runtime.generaldb.Strabon 
			 class. 
			
			*A big part of the temporal functions of stSPARQL has been
			imlemented. These functions include:
				*The temporal relation functions during, periodOverlaps, 
				equalsPeriod, nequalsPeriod, adjacent, before, after, 
				overleft, overright, meets, starts, finishes.
				
				*The period constructors period_intersect, period_union,
				 preceding_period, and succeeding_period. The last two
				 constructors are implemented using the jtemporal library.
				 The other functions are implemented in the database,
				 being mapped into the respective functions of PostgreSQL
				 Temporal. A complete reference of PostgreSQL Temporal 
				 can be found here: http://temporal.projects.pgfoundry.org/reference.html.
				 
				 *The temporal constants "NOW" and "UC" (Until Changed) 
				 are supported.
				 
			*The vocabulary of the valid time dimension of stSPARQL can
			be found at the TemporalConstants class of the evaluation 
			module.
				 		
	* Changed behaviour of Strabon and Strabon Endpoint for connecting to
	a spatially-enabled database. Only one instance of Strabon is allowed
	at a time.

	* Implemented a Java client for Strabon Endpoint. The client should be
	used only with endpoint versions >=3.2.5. The implementation may be
	found int the `endpoint-client' submodule of maven. Currently, only
	querying of Strabon Endpoints is supported.

	* Added support for requesting the capabilities of Strabon Endpoint
	(fixes Bug #20 <http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/20>). See
	changesets f840796400bf and ?<TBC>? for specific details and how you
	can determine the capabilities of older endpoints (versions <= 3.2.4).

	* Updated KML writer to include the projected variables of an stSPARQL
	query in "ExtendedData" and "Data" tags. This is the proper way to
	do it if we need to convert a KML to a ESRI shapefile and also include
	such information as attributes for a feature. See related pages from
	KML specification:
		<https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#extendeddata>
		<https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/extendeddata>

	* Added user authentication for storing RDF data through Strabon
	Endpoint. The credentials are specified in
	WEB-INF/credentials.properties file.

	* Strabon Endpoints now limits the number of the results to a maximum
	one. The maximum number is specified in the beans.xml file. This
	corresponds to parameter "maxLimit". The endpoint script has also been
	updated correspondingly; the limit can be given using the option "-l".
	One can disable limiting of query results, by setting the "maxLimit"
	parameter to 0. Addresses Bug #6
	(<http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/6>).

	* Added "Known Issues" section to README.

	* Added -m (more memory) and -M (much more memory) options in strabon
	script for out-of-memory exceptions.

	* Fixed Bug #10 (<http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/10>). Now
	KMLWriter handles more geometric types (other than polygons). See
	changeset 9a3bfee64a39.

	* Menu and navigation in Strabon Endpoint has changed to use jquery.
	The menu is now populated using the queries placed inside the beans.xml.

	* Added BrowseBean and browse.jsp for browsing the RDF data using the
	Strabon Endpoint.
