	* Version 3.2.8 released.

Wed Jan 09 18:06:41 2013   Pyravlos Team

	* Version 3.2.7 released.

	* Add an extension function 
	<http://strdf.di.uoa.gr/extensions/ontology#diffDateTime> for computing the
	span (in milliseconds) between two timestamps.

	* Added an <endpoint-exec> module. This module builds an executable jar file 
	with an embedded Apache Tomcat 7. To create and run the executable jar just 
	type:
		$ mvn clean package
		$ java -jar endpoint-exec/target/strabon-endpoint-executable-*.jar

	* Modified strabon script and postgis/monetdb.StoreOP class to get an
	option for storing a RDF file in a named graph. Moreover, the RDF
	format of the input RDF file now is given as an option (still, if it
	is missing, it is assumed that the input is in N-TRIPLES format). The
	option for the format is -f and the option for the named graph is -g
	(takes a URI as an argument).

	* Modified the names of the stSPARQL extension functions that
	utilize the minimum bounding boxes of the involved geometries.

	* Version 3.2.6 released.

	* Modified the names of the stSPARQL extension functions to comply  
	with the OGC Simple Features Access standard.

	* Version 3.2.5 released.

	* Added support for querying temporal information. This functionality
	may be found in the `temporals' branch. 
	
		The datatypes <http://strdf.di.uoa.gr/ontology#period> and
		<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime> are used to
		represent periods and instants respectively.
	
		The valid time time of triples is represented using quadtruples,
		with the valid time annotation(instant or period) being the
		fourth element of the quad. In the same way, temporal triple
		patterns are used in queries to retrieve the valid time of
		triples.
		
		Some functions have been renamed (their URIs have changed) to
		follow the names of the respective relations of Allen's
		interval algebra and other functions have been added. 
		
		The following temporal functions are supported:
		during, periodOverlaps, equalsPeriod, nequalsPeriod, adjacent,
		before, after, overleft, overright, meets, starts, finishes, 
		period_intersect, period_union, preceding_period, and
		succeeding_period.
	
	* Changed behaviour of Strabon and Strabon Endpoint for connecting to
	a spatially-enabled database. Only one instance of Strabon is allowed
	at a time.

	* Implemented a Java client for Strabon Endpoint. The client should be
	used only with endpoint versions >=3.2.5. The implementation may be
	found int the `endpoint-client' submodule of maven. Currently, only
	querying of Strabon Endpoints is supported.

	* Added support for requesting the capabilities of Strabon Endpoint
	(fixes Bug #20 <http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/20>). See
	changesets f840796400bf and ?<TBC>? for specific details and how you
	can determine the capabilities of older endpoints (versions <= 3.2.4).

	* Updated KML writer to include the projected variables of an stSPARQL
	query in "ExtendedData" and "Data" tags. This is the proper way to
	do it if we need to convert a KML to a ESRI shapefile and also include
	such information as attributes for a feature. See related pages from
	KML specification:
		<https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#extendeddata>
		<https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/extendeddata>

	* Added user authentication for storing RDF data through Strabon
	Endpoint. The credentials are specified in
	WEB-INF/credentials.properties file.

	* Strabon Endpoints now limits the number of the results to a maximum
	one. The maximum number is specified in the beans.xml file. This
	corresponds to parameter "maxLimit". The endpoint script has also been
	updated correspondingly; the limit can be given using the option "-l".
	One can disable limiting of query results, by setting the "maxLimit"
	parameter to 0. Addresses Bug #6
	(<http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/6>).

	* Added "Known Issues" section to README.

	* Added -m (more memory) and -M (much more memory) options in strabon
	script for out-of-memory exceptions.

	* Fixed Bug #10 (<http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/10>). Now
	KMLWriter handles more geometric types (other than polygons). See
	changeset 9a3bfee64a39.

	* Menu and navigation in Strabon Endpoint has changed to use jquery.
	The menu is now populated using the queries placed inside the beans.xml.

	* Added BrowseBean and browse.jsp for browsing the RDF data using the
	Strabon Endpoint.
