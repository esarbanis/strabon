	* Version 3.2.6 released.

	* Modified the names of the stSPARQL extension functions to comply  
	with the OGC Simple Features Access standard 

	* Version 3.2.5 released.

	* Added support for querying temporal information.

	* Changed behaviour of Strabon and Strabon Endpoint for connecting to
	a spatially-enabled database. Only one instance of Strabon is allowed
	at a time.

	* Implemented a Java client for Strabon Endpoint. The client should be
	used only with endpoint versions >=3.2.5. The implementation may be
	found int the `endpoint-client' submodule of maven. Currently, only
	querying of Strabon Endpoints is supported.

	* Added support for requesting the capabilities of Strabon Endpoint
	(fixes Bug #20 <http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/20>). See
	changesets f840796400bf and ?<TBC>? for specific details and how you
	can determine the capabilities of older endpoints (versions <= 3.2.4).

	* Updated KML writer to include the projected variables of an stSPARQL
	query in "ExtendedData" and "Data" tags. This is the proper way to
	do it if we need to convert a KML to a ESRI shapefile and also include
	such information as attributes for a feature. See related pages from
	KML specification:
		<https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#extendeddata>
		<https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/extendeddata>

	* Added user authentication for storing RDF data through Strabon
	Endpoint. The credentials are specified in
	WEB-INF/credentials.properties file.

	* Strabon Endpoints now limits the number of the results to a maximum
	one. The maximum number is specified in the beans.xml file. This
	corresponds to parameter "maxLimit". The endpoint script has also been
	updated correspondingly; the limit can be given using the option "-l".
	One can disable limiting of query results, by setting the "maxLimit"
	parameter to 0. Addresses Bug #6
	(<http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/6>).

	* Added "Known Issues" section to README.

	* Added -m (more memory) and -M (much more memory) options in strabon
	script for out-of-memory exceptions.

	* Fixed Bug #10 (<http://bug.strabon.di.uoa.gr/ticket/10>). Now KMLWriter 
	handles more geometric types (other than polygons). See changeset 
	9a3bfee64a39.

	* Menu and navigation in Strabon Endpoint has changed to use jquery.
	The menu is now populated using the queries placed inside the beans.xml.

	* Added BrowseBean and browse.jsp for browsing the RDF data using the
	Strabon Endpoint.
